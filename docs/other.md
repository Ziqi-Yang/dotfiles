- `mpv` watch local video & listen to audio
- [`yesplaymusic`](https://github.com/qier222/YesPlayMusic) high-value third-party netease music player
- `obstudio` record and stream 
- `blender` video edit & 3D modeling & 2D animation & ...    
    `kendlive` is also great, however, it is unstable. And I cannot open it on my Arch Linux using whatever method I try.

### OCR

use [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc)

```bash
paru -S tesseract gimagereader-qt tesseract-data-chi_sim tesseract-data-eng
```

use `gimagereader-qt` as the front end(`gimagereader-gtk` also works, and seems more morden, but will sometimes go into idle)
